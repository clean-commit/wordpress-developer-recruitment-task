## Task

- [ ] Create a theme for the landing page using [roots/sage theme](https://github.com/roots/sage)
- [ ] Prepare a hero section using ACF Flexible Content (We should be able to replicate this section infinitely on any page)
- [ ] Export DB as SQL file and add it to the theme folder
- [ ] Default domain for the project should be `wp-recruitment-env.test`
- [ ] Theme folder should be called `[github-handle]-cc-wp`

## Description

This is a simple task for WordPress devs, all you need to do is spin up a local env that supports roots/bedrock, create a new theme, and prepare one section using ACF Flexible Content (this section has to be available on every page (excluding posts)).

The design can be found in the sources library in .fig in the sources directory.

ACF plugin can be found in the `plugins` folder.

## Rules & Hints

1. You can use any JS framework to complete the task (Alpine/React/Vue are recommended)
2. Use TailwindCSS for styling
3. Use Blade as templating language.
4. Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions, etc. (Your code is your business card)
5. Make sure images are correctly optimized
6. Send us access to your repo to check out your work!
7. Only use ACF & Classic Editor plugins (except mu-plugins)
8. ACF fields must be saved as a `.json` file when changes are made automatically in the theme folder.
9. Make sure website is optimized for accessibility & performance.
